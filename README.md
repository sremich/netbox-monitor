# netbox-monitor

Network auto-documentation service that keeps [NetBox](https://netbox.dev) continuously in
sync with reality. It runs alongside NetBox (not inside it) and talks to everything over
APIs:

| Module | What it does | Default interval |
|---|---|---|
| **dhcp** | Mirrors Technitium DHCP leases: dynamic leases become IPAddress records (deleted when the lease expires); reservations become full Devices | 60s |
| **dns** | Collates Technitium DNS zones with NetBox IPs: sets `dns_name`, reports drift | 5 min |
| **discovery** | Ping-sweeps every active NetBox prefix *outside* the DHCP scopes; responders become Devices with MAC, OUI manufacturer, reverse-DNS name | 15 min |
| **availability** | Pings all discovered/reserved hosts; unreachable > 10 min → tagged `stale` + status offline, auto-recovers when back | 60s |
| **proxmox** | Syncs PVE nodes, QEMU VMs and LXC containers (resources, interfaces, IPs via guest agent) into NetBox virtualization | 5 min |
| **lldp** | Crawls the switch fabric from `lldp-source` seeds (Cisco/Arista/Aruba/MikroTik/UniFi over SSH, or SNMP), auto-creates discovered switches, and documents links as cables | 30 min |
| **certs** | Probes TLS ports on every host with a primary IP; records expiry/issuer/CN, tags `cert-expiring` / `cert-expired` | daily |

Everything the service creates is tagged `managed:netbox-monitor` plus a source tag
(`src:dhcp`, `src:scan`, `src:proxmox`, `src:lldp`). **It never deletes or lifecycle-edits
records that don't carry its tags** — your hand-curated documentation is safe.

## Web UI (v2)

v2 ships a built-in web UI at **http://\<host\>:8899**:

- **First run** asks you to set a password (or pre-set `WEBUI_PASSWORD` in `.env`).
- **Settings**: NetBox URL + token (with a connection test), per-module **polling
  intervals** and enable switches, lifecycle rules, dry-run toggle, log level.
- **Sites**: define any number of sites — each pairs a **NetBox Site** (picked from
  the sites already in your NetBox, or created on the fly) with its own **Technitium
  instance**, **Proxmox instances**, and **discovery scanning scope** (prefix pickers
  populated live from NetBox). Every section has a Test button.
- **Dashboard**: per-module / per-site last-run status and **Run now** buttons.

Configuration edits apply immediately — the sync engine hot-reloads without a restart.
The live config persists in `data/settings.json` (keep the data volume!); `config.yaml`
is only imported on first start when no settings.json exists. **v1 configs migrate
automatically** into a single site.

## Quick start

Everything is configured in the **web UI** — no config files are required to start.
You need a Linux host with Docker, ideally one that can reach every VLAN you want to
scan (ARP-based MAC/vendor enrichment only works for L2-adjacent subnets).

### Option A — straight from the published image (no clone)

Create one file, `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  netbox-monitor:
    image: ghcr.io/sremich/netbox-monitor:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host          # web UI on http://<host>:8899, and LAN access for discovery
    cap_add: [NET_RAW, NET_ADMIN]  # raw ICMP for ping discovery
    # environment:
    #   - WEBUI_PASSWORD=change-me   # optional: skip the first-run password prompt
    volumes:
      - netbox-monitor-data:/app/data
volumes:
  netbox-monitor-data:
```

Then:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Or a one-liner with no compose file at all:

```sh
docker run -d --name netbox-monitor --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host --cap-add NET_RAW --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  -v netbox-monitor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/sremich/netbox-monitor:latest
```

### Option B — clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sremich/netbox-monitor
cd netbox-monitor
docker compose up -d        # pulls the image; no .env or config.yaml needed
```

(To build the image from source instead of pulling: `docker compose build` first, or
add `build: .` under the service.)

### First run

1. Open **http://\<host\>:8899** and set an admin password (or pre-set `WEBUI_PASSWORD`).
2. **Settings → NetBox**: enter your NetBox URL + an API token (Admin → API Tokens, write
   access) and hit *Test*.
3. **Sites → Add site**: pick/create a NetBox Site and add that site's Technitium
   instance, Proxmox instance(s), and scan scope — each section has a *Test* button.
   - *Technitium* token: `curl "http://<dns>:5380/api/user/createToken?user=admin&pass=...&tokenName=netbox-monitor"`
   - *Proxmox* token: Datacenter → Permissions → API Tokens, e.g. `monitor@pve` /
     `netbox-monitor`, with the `PVEAuditor` role on `/`.
4. Toggle modules on and adjust intervals under **Settings**. Turn on **dry-run** first
   if you want to watch what it *would* write before it writes anything.

Config edits apply immediately (the engine hot-reloads). Everything persists in the
`netbox-monitor-data` volume — **keep that volume** across upgrades. Upgrade with
`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

> Optional: a `.env` file (see `.env.example`) can pre-seed `WEBUI_PASSWORD` and tokens,
> and `config.yaml` (see `config.example.yaml`) can seed the whole config on first start
> — both are optional and the compose file works without them.

### Headless / CLI

The image also runs a single module once and exits (useful for cron or testing):

```sh
docker compose run --rm netbox-monitor --once dhcp --dry-run
```

Modules: `dhcp`, `dns`, `discovery`, `availability`, `proxmox`, `lldp`, `certs`.

### LLDP topology crawl (optional)

The LLDP module maps your physical switch fabric and draws it as NetBox cables. It
**crawls**: from a few seed switches it reads LLDP neighbors, follows switch-to-switch
links, auto-creates any switch it finds, authenticates to it, and continues — so you
only have to seed a couple of switches to map the whole fabric.

1. **Seed** a switch or two: tag them `lldp-source` in NetBox, give each a primary IP,
   assign them to a Site, and set their platform (`cisco`, `arista`, `aruba`, `mikrotik`,
   `unifi`, … — used to pick the driver; unknown platforms are auto-detected).
2. **Site credentials** (site page → LLDP topology): the SSH user/password and/or SNMP
   community for that site's switches — tried first against everything at the site.
3. **Global credential profiles** (Settings → LLDP topology crawl): a list of
   name + driver + SSH/SNMP secrets tried, in order, against every switch the crawl
   discovers. Also set the crawl toggle and `max switches`/`max depth` bounds here.
4. Enable LLDP for the site and turn crawl on.

Supported drivers: **Cisco** IOS/NX-OS, **Arista** EOS, **Aruba** (CX + ArubaOS-Switch),
**MikroTik** RouterOS, **UniFi** (all over SSH), and **SNMP** LLDP-MIB for anything else
with SNMP enabled. Discovered switches become NetBox devices (role **Switch**, tagged
`src:lldp`) with their management IP; a working driver+credential is cached per switch so
later runs skip the trial loop. Only neighbors matching a known switch vendor are crawled,
so hosts that merely advertise a bridge (e.g. Linux/Proxmox nodes) are never touched.

Optional per-switch credentials: install the
[netbox-secrets](https://github.com/Onemind-Services-LLC/netbox-secrets) plugin, point
`lldp.secrets_private_key` at your RSA key, and attach secrets to switch devices
(role `snmp` → community; role `ssh` → name = username, plaintext = password). Plugin
credentials take precedence.

> **Switch ACLs**: many switches restrict SSH/SNMP to a management subnet (Cisco vty
> `access-class`). Permit the host running netbox-monitor, or the crawl will log those
> switches as unreachable (it stops after one connection-reset rather than retrying).

**A switch isn't being polled?** The dashboard status names each failed host with the
drivers tried and the error each returned (e.g. `10.0.0.5: cisco/TimeoutError`); the log
carries the full messages. Two common causes:

- **SSH doesn't work on that model.** Some switches (e.g. Cisco Small Business SG300)
  only offer crypto too old to negotiate, but answer **SNMP** fine. Set an SNMP community
  in the site's LLDP settings or a credential profile — with no community configured the
  SNMP driver is never tried and the switch just fails every SSH attempt.
- **The seed is on the wrong site.** Seeds are looked up *per site*, so an
  `lldp-source` switch whose NetBox Site isn't one of your configured sites is never
  polled — easy to miss after moving sites. The log flags these at startup
  (*"lldp seed switch is at a site with no LLDP-enabled config"*); fix it by moving the
  device to the right Site in NetBox.

**Protecting production gear.** Two safeguards keep the crawl from ever hammering a
router/firewall:

- **Document-only exclusion list** (Settings → LLDP topology crawl → *Never authenticate
  these hosts*): listed IPs are drawn into the topology from neighbor data but the tool
  **never opens an SSH/SNMP session to them**. Use it for production routers.
- **No credential spraying**: when a switch's vendor is known (platform or LLDP
  description) only that one driver's login is tried, and there's a hard per-host cap
  (`max_auth_attempts`, default 4) so a device is never hit with a barrage of logins.

## Cleanup / migrating sites

The **Cleanup** page (top nav) inventories every object this service created — devices,
VMs, IPs, cables, all tagged `managed:netbox-monitor` — grouped by site, source, and
staleness. You can then bulk-delete a selection (by site, source, "only stale", or "not
seen in N days"), with a **Preview (count only)** step and an explicit confirm before
anything is removed. Human-created objects are never touched. Optionally tick *Re-run
discovery afterwards* to recreate hosts fresh on the current site.

Two things to know when **moving everything to a different NetBox site**:

- The sync **auto-migrates** a device to the site that re-discovers it *when it's matched
  by MAC* — so MAC-known hosts re-home themselves. Hosts discovered by ping only (no ARP
  MAC) are matched by name and stay put; use Cleanup to remove them and let the next
  discovery recreate them on the right site.
- Discovery only scans prefixes **scoped to a site's NetBox Site** — unless you run a
  **single** configured site, in which case it scans all active prefixes. So for a
  multi-site setup, scope your prefixes to each NetBox Site (or set per-site
  include-prefixes); the dashboard flags a site that has nothing to scan.

## NetBox objects it maintains

- Tags: `managed:netbox-monitor`, `src:*`, `stale`, `cert-expiring`, `cert-expired`
- Custom fields: `last_seen`, `discovered_mac`, `oui_vendor` (IP/device),
  `dhcp_scope` (prefix), `cert_expiry`/`cert_issuer`/`cert_cn` (device/VM)
- Device roles: `Discovered`, `Hypervisor`, `Switch`

## Development

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check . && pytest
```

## Backlog / future ideas

- **Notification system** (planned next): unified alerts via ntfy/Discord/webhooks for
  cert expiry (replacing tag-only warnings), stale transitions, and rogue devices.
- Rogue-device alerting: flag never-before-seen MACs from discovery.
- IP conflict detection: same IP answering with different MACs across scans.
- Service discovery: light TCP probe → NetBox Service objects.
- Prefix utilization + DNS drift reports as scheduled journal entries.
- Config backup integration (Oxidized) linked from device pages.
